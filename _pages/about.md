Software Engineer with a passion for travel photography.

My current professional goal is to be certified as a multi-cloud architect and to be able to help companies to migrate their workloads to the cloud.
Among multiple passions, I love to travel and take pictures of the places I visit. I also enjoy reading and learning about new technologies constantly, such as Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Software Architecture.

I'm currently based in Santiago, Chile, and not open to relocation for the time being.

On this website, you can find my [resume](/cv), [tech guide posts](/blog) both in English and Spanish, and my travel photography portfolio.
